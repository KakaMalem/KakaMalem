when removing from cart or increasing/reducing quantity to quickly I get errors fix it without slowing down the interactivity speed. and the add to cart button on product card and product details page are too slow and not very responsive, fix them, but make sure to not make the same errors as the quick buttons mentioned above

alpha active wear store is bugging on admin panel

adding variant options require hard refresh to see the generated options, fix this

there's a problem with how we're managing the variant selection in the product details page. I can't see the options nor select them if a product has only large for some colors, and small for other colors, without intersecting, I can't select one or the other altogether

account/orders don't show the product images if it only have images for variants

stop the dark mode on systems from making the website dark
