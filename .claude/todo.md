a note field should be added to orders, placeholder should be "Is there anything you'd like to tell us about this order e.g. "bring it between 9-11am otherwise I'm not home""

A proper redirect system for logged in users on auth pages, redirect on server

add a proper profile picture system so users can add their own

show the payment and delivery status on orders collection page by default

after order verification email isn't sent

review not shown in the product card and details page properly (only shown in some places)

it says token expired after I'm logged in instead of redirecting and showing success page. it shouldn't say token expired and show an error message if I'm successfully logged in

the product details page should have the default image already on screen when I come in (cuz it's loaded in the card already) it shouldn't take that much time to load, plus instead of "no Image" it should have a loading effect while it's loading, same for changing variants cuz the images show "no image" until they load
